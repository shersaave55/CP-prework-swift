# App Idea
A potential app that i want to create is a mix of the spotify and flora app. I want people to be able to listen to their favorite music and then once they reach the end of their playlist, they can share a moment (taking a selfie) with their friends or alone. If they decide to share the photo publicly using a hashtag to contribute to one of the enviormental causes (the share is a donation to the organization). If they dont  decide to share the app then they can simply take their photo and save it. 

The overall idea is to provide a fun expirience for the user while also providing an incentive of contributing to the good of nature. The implementation of this is definelty a mix of spotify, flora and BeReal. These three apps would be the groundwork for inspiration.
